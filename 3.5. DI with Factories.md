In the previous notes, we have seen, how to inject dependencies using custom injector and NgModule(). Now we are gonnaa see how to
inject dependencies which has parameters.

Imaging we have service named ```ParameterizedApiService``` for interacting with web services, which has one parameter called url. Provided value of url will be used by the ParameterizedApiService during webservice interaction, so in real application development, it will be help-ful for us to give different service
endpoints based on the environments ```dev/qa/stage```
```js
export class ParameterizedApiService {

  constructor(private url:string) { }

  get(): void {
   console.log(this.url);
  }

}

```
We can inject the above parametrized service in modules using factory,

Eg:
```js
providers: [
ParameterizedApiService,
{
provide: ParameterizedApiService,
useFactory: (): ParamService => new ParamService('https://dev.myservice.com/get')
}
]
```
