In this chapter we will have a deep dive in Angular(Angular2) modules and following are the topics which we are going to cover

* What is an Angular2 Module ?

* Angular 2 Modules vs ES6 modules

* What is a Root Module ?

* Making modules more readable using the spread operator

* Angular 2 Modules and Visibility

* Angular 2 Modules and Dependency Injection - Avoid surprises

* Dynamic bootstrapping and Just In Time compilation

* The Angular 2 Ahead Of Time compiler in action

* Static bootstrapping

* Feature Modules

* Angular 2 Modules And The Router

* Lazy Loading a Module using the Router

* Shared Modules and Lazy Loading

* Conclusions and Pitfall Summary

What is an Angular2 Module ?
Basic building block of any angular application and close counter part of Angularjs1 modules(using the same term really helps making the transition smoother).

Angular modules consolidate components, directives, services and pipes into cohesive blocks of functionality.

We can see here some of the Angular2 modules with their related primitives

"Router" module is a good example of Angular2 modules, it combines router directives(router-outlet, router-link) and router services(ActivatedRoute) in a single unit(@angular/router).

"Form" is a another module which has reactive form directives and services, these directives and services are aware of each other and interrelated.


What does an Angular2 Module look

```js
@NgModule({
    declarations: [App],
    imports: [BrowserModule, ReactiveFormsModule],
    bootstrap: [App],
    providers: [AuthenticationService,..]
})
```
We can see here several things going on:

* the @NgModule annotation is what actually defines the module

* we can list the components, directives and pipes that are part of the module in the declarations array

* we can import other modules by listing them in the imports array

* we can list the services that are part of the module in the providers array, but we will see later why this should only be used in some cases
