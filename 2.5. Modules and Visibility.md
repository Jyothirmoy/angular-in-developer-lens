To understand how module visibility works in Angular 2, lets now define a separate module with only one component called Home:

```js
import {Home} from "./home.component";

@NgModule({
    declarations: [Home]
})
export class HomeModule {

}
```

Let's now try to use in our root module, by importing it:

```
import {HomeModule} from "./home.module";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [BrowserModule, HomeModule],
  providers: [UserService, LessonsService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})

export class AppModule {

}
```

You might be surprised to find out that this does not work. Even if you use the ```<home></home>``` component in your template, nothing will get rendered


Why isn't the Home component visible ?
It turns out that adding Home to the declarations of HomeModule does not automatically make the component visible to any other modules that might be importing it.

This is because the Home Component might be just an implementation detail of the module that we don't want to make publicly available.

To make it publicly available, we need to export it:

```
@NgModule({
    declarations: [Home],
    exports: [Home]
})
export class HomeModule {

}
```
With this, the ```Home``` component would now be correctly rendered in any template that uses the ```home``` HTML tag.

Notice that we could also have only exported it without adding it to ```declarations```. This would happen in the case where the component is not used internally inside the module.

### Could we still import the component directly ?
If we try to use a component directly that is not part of a module, we will get the following error:
```
Unhandled Promise rejection: Component Home is not part of any NgModule or the module has not been imported into your module.
```
This ensures that we only use components on our templates that have been declared as part of the public API of a given module.
