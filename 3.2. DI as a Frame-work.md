In previous section we have seen about Dependency Injection, in this section we will see the role of a frame-work in realtion with Dependency Injection

In our User example, we have create the object for "AuthenticationService" and passed to Login method
```js
var authService = new AuthenticationService();
Login(authService);

```
The draw back of the above code is,
* Now AuthenticationService has been created with out any dependencies(new AuthenticationService()), what If in future "AuthenticationService" has been changed to get one/more dependencies(like cookies,...) then we have to change our code to call the "Authentication service" with required dependencies
* Currently Login has only one dependency(AuthenticationService), But what If the dependency list is going to more in future, then for every dependencies we have to create object manually and has pass Login method.

It makes our code more difficult to manage, this is where DI Frame-work will comes to the picture.
Framework will provides(decorators in Angular) a way to configure the dependencies of a module. When the module object is required, then looking into the dependency configuration DI frame-work will create the serve the dependencies.
In this way it help us over-comes the above hurdles.

Note: Angular DI frame-work will provides more additional features like "conditional dependencies creation", will look those details in the next chapter.
