# What is routing
   Routing is a way to split the different part of application based on the browser URL


# Why we need routing:
  * Separate the application into different parts -login, home, about...
  * Managing the application state -Bookmarks any state(page) of the application and coming back to same state in required time.
  * Procteting application areas based on certain rules - Pushing users to login into the application, to see/interact with any views,

## Difficulties:
* Synching the application state with browser URL
  Imagine we are developing news application, In home page we are showing list of articles and when user clicks any article than corresponding article detailed info will be shown to users. Selected article details was gathered from the article list(previous) page, technically no server communication for showing the article detail. As no server communication required, If we maintain same URL for article-list and article detail than we won't able to share/book-mark the article details page. As the URL for article-list and detail both are same.
* Single page app(SPA) 
  In single page application, Server gives a single page and its the responsibility of client side routing to manage the different parts of the application with different URL. To understand this clearly we are going to see about jump navigation Traditionally, <a> tags was used to navigate between different parts with-in a webpage. For example

```js
<! --- Home.html--->
...
<!-- ... lots of page content here ... -->
<a name="about"><h1>About</h1></a>      
...

```

above is the home page of our application and its URL is "http://myapp/home" and when we visited "http://myapp/home/#about", the browser would jump straight to that H1 tag that identified by the about anchor. The above behavior is called "Jump navigation" and it's cleverly adopted by modern web frame-works for managing the different parts of application in client-side with in URL hashes, HTML5 browser api allows to create the browser navigation history without the need for a request.
i.e. Application will served by the single URL from the server end, With the help of jump navigation client side frame-works will tweak the same URL for managing different parts of the app state and by leveraging HTML5 browser features navigation history will be maintained for those internal states
 
# Routing in Angular frame-work

Angularjs1 router - "ngRoute" was not addressed all the need(nested routes, passing data) of application development, So almost all the application in Angularjs1 used "ui-router". "ui-router" created by community and more popular than Angularjs1 official router(ngRoute). ui-router("ng2 UI-router") was updated for Angular2. to makes smoother update from AngularJS UI-router to ng2 UI-router.

Angular2 router implementation was inspired from ui-router, But built for the components, Let's compare syntax of UI-router both versions with Angular2 Router to understand this clearly

Angularjs UI-router

```js
app.config(function($stateProvider){
    $stateProvider.state('home', {
        url: '/home',
        templateUrl: 'home.html',
        controller: 'HomeCtrl'
    })
});

```

Angular2 UI-router(ng2 UI-router):

```js

export let state1: Ng2StateDeclaration = {
    name: 'home',
    component: HomeComponent,
    url: '/home'
}

@NgModule({
 imports: [
   SharedModule,
   UIRouterModule.forChild({ states: [home] })
 ],
declarations: [HomeComponent]
})
export class MyModule {}

```

Angular2 Router :

```js

import {
    RouteConfig,
    Route
} from 'angular2/router';
import {HomeComponent} from './components/home';

@Component({})
@RouteConfig([
    new Route({ 
        path: '/home', 
        component: HomeComponent, 
        name: 'Home'
    })
])
export class App {...}

```

As we can see, in general, Angular2 Router is pretty much the same. As addition need to say that it support most of the common features like static/dynamic data sharing through the routes, nested views etc.

* Same location strategies (Path and Hash)
* Similar route definitions
* Similar services:
   * $state.go and Router.navigate
   * $stateParams and RouteParams
   * $state.current.data and RouteData
* Similar directives
   * ui-view and router-outlet
   * ui-sref and routerLink


Angular2 Router had taken best of UI-router experience and implemented it. If you need easy migrate your code base with AngularJS UI-router to Angular2 fast and smoothly, you can try Ng2 UI-router, otherwise, Angular2 Router will fit best.
