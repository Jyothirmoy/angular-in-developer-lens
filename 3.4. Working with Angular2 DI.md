# Dependency Injection in Angular
When writing our apps in Angular(Angular > 1.x) there are three steps we need to take in order to perform an injection:
1. Create the service class
2. Declare the dependencies on the receiving component and
3. Configure the injection (i.e. register the injection with Angular in our NgModule )

The first thing we do is create the service class, that is, the class that exposes some behavior we want
to use. This will be called the injectable because it is the thing that our components will receive via
the injection. We normally add the @Injectable decorator to a service class.

Here is how we would create a service:
```js
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class ApiService {

  description : string;

  constructor() { }

  getDescription(): string {
    return this.description
  }

  setDescription(text:string): void {
    this.description = text;
  }
}
```

```Note```: the @Injectable decorator is only needed, when injecting other depedencies to ApiService. In above case it's not depends on any dependencies, So adding @Injectable decorator is optional. But the Angular creators recommends adding the
@Injectable decorator to every service class, even those that donâ€™t have dependencies, for future proofing and consistency.


And then we declare it on the constructor:
```js
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'app works!';

  constructor(private apiService: ApiService){
    
  }
}
```
When we declare the injection in our component constructor, Angular will do some reflection to figure out what class to inject. That is, Angular will see that we are looking for an object of type ApiService in the constructor and check the DI system for an appropriate injection.



The final step for using dependency injection, telling Angular which thing to inject when a component declares its dependencies. By adding the dependencies into our @NgModules() providers list, as mentioned below
```js
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [....],
  providers: [ { provide: ApiService, useClass: ApiService } ] // <- Adding dependencies here
})
```
In this case, we use the token ApiService to expose the singleton of the class ApiService . When the token and class name both are same then we can mentioned it simply as

```providers: [ ApiService ]```

It's shorthand version of above. The descriptive declaration pattern will be very use-ful for injecting any dependency with different name. Consider, If we want to unit test our component, During testing we will use "MockService"(as unit test case shouldn't depend on external environments) in that
we can simply change our providers declaration to use MockService instead of the original service as
```providers: [ { provide: ApiService, useClass: MockService } ]```


When we added dependecy in @NgModules() providers list than Singleton instance of the dependency will be provided to the whole application as Angularjs1. But we can get different instance of dependency by creating our own injector, as below

```js
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'app works!';
  apiService: ApiService;
  
  constructor(){
    //creating new injector with required dependency token
    const injector: any = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([ApiService]);

    this.apiService = injector.get(ApiService);
  }
}
```
```resolveAndCreate``` is the static method of ReflectiveInjector class, which is available angular core package.


"ApiService" created from adding the dependency in @NgModule() providers list and the one created through custom injector are different instance of same service, to illustrate this different clearly. I have changed our "AppComponent" implementation as below

```js

export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  title = 'app works!';
  localService: ApiService;

  constructor(private apiService: ApiService){
    
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    const injector: any = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([ApiService]);

    this.localService = injector.get(ApiService);

    /*
     *Setting description to Singleton instance of the service,
     */
    this.apiService.setDescription("api service");
   
   /*
     *Setting description to locallly created service,
     */
    this.localService.setDescription("local service");


    console.log(this.apiService.getDescription()); // will print "api service"

    console.log(this.localService.getDescription()); //will print "local service"
  }

}

```

As both are different instances, this.apiService.getDescription() method will print "api service" and this.localService.getDescription() will print "local service".
