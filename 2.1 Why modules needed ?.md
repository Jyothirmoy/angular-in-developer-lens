## Why modules - @NgModules ?
An module allows Angular to define a context for compiling templates. For example when Angular is parsing HTML templates, its looking for a certain list of components, directives and pipes.

Each HTML tag is compared to that list to see if a component should be applied on top of it, the same goes for each attribute. The problem is: how does Angular know which components, directives and pipes should it be looking for while parsing the HTML?

That is when Angular 2 modules come in, they provide that exact information in a single place.

So in summary we can say the following about Angular 2 modules:
they are essential for template parsing, both in the Just In Time / Ahead Of Time Compilation as we will see
they are also very useful for documenting group of related functionality. 
They can be used to clarify which components and directives are meant to be used publicly vs internal implementation details, as we will soon see
