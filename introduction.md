# Introduction:
## Why this material?
When so many articles are there out for Angular2, the main pushing factors behind of this material is
Most of the articles are giving there explaination on "What ....?", but they forget/never speaks about "Why ....?". 
 eg: "What is Dependency injection(DI)?" instead of "Why Dependency injection(DI)?".
   The reason for my stress on "Why..?" is, when start your leaps on "Why...?" it's like understanding the question with answer and on other hand "What" is like directly jumping into the answer. The advantage of understanding the solution with problem is.
* users will able to apply the solution in right places, if the problem comes with diffrent dress(e.g like "What is Angular?" and "Describe Angular?". Even though both are different the answer for them is same).
* most of the times users will come with better solutions for the problem.
