## Why this material?
When so many articles are there out for Angular2, the main pushing factors behind of this material are
* Most of the articles are giving there explaination on "What ....?", but they forget/never speaks about "Why ....?". 
 eg: "What is Dependency injection(DI)?" instead of "Why Dependency injection(DI)?".
   The reason for my stress on "Why..?" is, when start your leaps on "Why...?" it's like understanding the question with and on other hand "What" is like directly jumping into the answer. The advantage of knowing the solution with problem is.
