## Getting into Angular2

Angular2 is open-source modern web frame-work built on javascript for building web & mobile applications.And with Typescript Angular2 is bringing Object oriented alike web development in front-end stream and the syntax is strikingly close to Java8.

At the end of 2014 Google announced that Angular 2 would be a complete rewrite of AngularJS, and they even created a new language “AtScript” that was meant to be used for writing Angular 2 applications.

But then Microsoft agreed to add support for decorators (a.k.a. annotations) to their TypeScript language (a strict superset of JavaScript), and so that emerged as the language for the development of the Angular 2 framework itself, and the recommended language for developing applications using the AngularJS framework.

You can also develop Angular 2 apps in JavaScript (both ECMAScript 5 and 6) and in Dart.

In addition, the Angular team integrated yet another Microsoft product - the RxJS library of reactive JavaScript extensions, into the Angular 2 framework.

Angular 2 is not an MVC framework, but rather a component-based framework. In Angular 2 an application is a tree of loosely coupled components.


The following are the basic constructs of an angular application
*Modules
*Components
*Services
*Directives
*Pipes

In the upcoming chapters, we will look each on very detailedly

Note: Here after we are going to refer "Angular2" as "Angular" and "Angular1.x" as "Angularjs"
