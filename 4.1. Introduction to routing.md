#What is routing
   Routing is a way to split the different part of application based on the browser URL


#Why we need routing:
  * Separate the application into different parts -login, home, about...
  * Managing the application state -Bookmarks any state(page) of the application and coming back to same state in required time.
  * Procteting application areas based on certain rules - Pushing users to login into the application, to see/interact with any views,

##Difficulties:
Synching the application state with browser URL
  Imagine we are developing news application, In home page we are showing list of articles and when user clicks any article than corresponding article detailed info will be shown to users. Selected article details was gathered from the article list(previous) page, technically no server communication for showing the article detail. As no server communication required, If we maintain same URL for article-list and article detail than we won't able to share/book-mark the article details page. As the URL for article-list and detail both are same.

Single page app(SPA) 
  In single page application, Server gives a single page and its the responsibility of client side routing to manage the different parts of the application with different URL. To understand this clearly we are going to see about jump navigation

Traditionally, <a> tags was used to navigate between different parts with-in a webpage. For example

```js
<! --- Home.html--->
...
<!-- ... lots of page content here ... -->
<a name="about"><h1>About</h1></a>       ggg
...

```

above is the home page of our application and its URL is "http://myapp/home" and when we visited "http://myapp/home/#about", the browser would jump straight to that H1 tag
that identified by the about anchor. The above behavior is called "Jump navigation" and it's cleverly adopted by modern web frame-works for managing the different parts of application in cliennt-side.
i.e. Application will served by the single URL from the server end, Using jump navigation client side frame-works will tweak the same URL for managing different parts of the app.
