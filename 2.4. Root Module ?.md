Each application only has one root module, and each component, directive and pipe should only be associated to a single module.
```js
@NgModule({
    declarations: [App],
    imports: [BrowserModule, RouterModule, FormsModule],
    bootstrap: [AppModule]
})
```
This is an example of an *Application Root* module:

Several things identify this as being a root module:

the root module has the conventional name of *AppModule*

the root module in the case of web applications imports the *BrowserModule*, which for example provides Browser specific renderers, and installs core directives like ngIf, ngFor, etc.

the *bootstrap* property is used, providing a list of components that should be used as bootstrap entry points for the application. There is usually only one element in this array: the root component of the application.
